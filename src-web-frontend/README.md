# RFID Music Player - Web Frontend

The web frontend is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It provides the following functionality:

* Map RFID tags to songs
* Add new music to the library (download from YouTube)


## Build Setup

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), a modern alternative to npm. It is recommended you use yarn, especially if you want to contribute. If you don't want to use yarn, just replace `yarn` with `npm` in all commands.

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build --report

# run unit tests
yarn run unit

# run e2e tests
yarn run e2e

# run all tests
yarn test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
